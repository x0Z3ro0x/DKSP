This resource was made possible thank to ESX_Policejob being used as a base. All changes to the script were made by x0Z3ro0x and are NOT an official release of ANY ESX based scripts. Please do not bug the ESX Developers on any bug fixes for this script. Instead post them here and I will make sure to handle it.
